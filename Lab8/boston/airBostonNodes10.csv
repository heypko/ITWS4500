I have easy, restriction-free, on-street parking here, and a back yard. Just one block from the house, there is a 7-11 convenience store, a dry-cleaner, a Mexican restaurant, a pizza parlor, a popular sports bar and grill (similar to an Irish Pub), and another restaurant for breakfast and lunch.  The house is located 1/2 mile from Roslindale Square where you will find more restaurants, 4 bakeries, the public library and the post office. There is a superb farmers market here every Saturday. The fast-train to downtown Boston stops there, too.","I am in a scenic part of Boston with a couple big parks nearby, and Jamaica Pond, where you can rent a sail boat or jog the paved perimeter path, within a mile away. Here is a clue to my personality:  Favorite singers are Judy Collins, Ari Hest, Miguel Bose and the British rock band, James. My top favorite places to travel to are Oaxaca, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary. In years gone by, I have had repeated trips to Paris and to Tunisia, also. These days I am mostly home, spending a lot of time in front of my iMac, writing copy, filling orders or coding for websites.","PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: From the house, quick public transportation to Forest Hills station (Orange Line and Commuter Rail) is via two nearby MBTA bus lines. The #38 bus stops one-half block away, and takes you past the Faulkner, then to Jamaica Plain and Forest Hills.  The #51 bus stops one block away, and goes a more direct route to Forest Hills. (The bus also goes to Cleveland Circle in Brookline.) Between the two bus lines, there is a bus that stops here every 15 minutes or so on weekdays; but no service on Sunday. ALSO, the apartment is just 1/2 mile walk to the Roslindale Village MBTA commuter rail stop, Needham Line. The train takes you to Ruggles Station at Northeastern Univ., to Back Bay station and to South Station in downtown Boston, in about 15 minutes time.  There are more city busses, running 7 days a week, from this MBTA rail station. You can also pick up ZIP Cars there.

In recent years I have had many trips to Mexico, where I buy folk art for my online business, called Viva Oaxaca Folk Art. I love meeting new people, especially travelers with stories to tell.  

In addition to the above, I run web sites for small companies, including a physical therapy practice, a cancer treatment center and a colonial era historic house and museum. 

In the 1980s, I was a publicist and concert producer, and have presented many concerts with Judy Collins, as well as with Ella Fitzgerald, Laura Nyro, Tom Rush, Barbara Cook and Karen Akers. Now I run a channel on YouTube called ""beta.hifi.archive"" that is a collection of 50 years of video clips from the career of Judy Collins.

If you're looking for a place to just crash and plan on being out and about, this is a nice cheap option. There were 2 other housemates that I met and they were both very nice and respectful. I rented a car and so needed to park it 2 blocks up the street overnight and by 8a.m. in the morning you need to start putting money in the meter or move your car.

10192583,2014-02-05,10644866,Mohit,"Before i say anything else i would like to talk about the host-Giuseppe. He is one damn helpful guy and is very responsive, who is always just a call away if you need any help. I was from abroad and it was my first trip to boston but i hardly faced any difficulty thanks to some really helpful advice from Giuseppe regarding the places, transport, restaurants etc. Talking about the room, it is pretty much the same what you read in the description. It has a private toilet(not bath) and a sink. The bed was very comfortable and i got some clean linen and blankets too. You dont get any furniture apart from the bed like a table or a chair and as said earlier its a pretty small room. The other room mates are quiet and are usually very busy, so don't be surprised if you are in the house all by yourself most of the times. Talking about the location- it has numerous restaurants which are just a couple of mins walk from home in brighton ave. There are a lot of places to eat and drink nearby. As far as transportation is concerned the nearest bus stops are just 5 minutes away by walking and as a student i had to go to longwood medical area everyday and had no difficulty doing it whatsoever. All in all the room and location were great and i had zero issues during 1 month of stay. I would recommend this to all those who are looking for a cheap accommodation in a safe and a happening location.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11325459,2014-03-30,12324976,Magnús,"The room was all it was made out to be. Very small, but with a closet and storage under the bed. At the bedhead, a sink with mirror. Shared spaces were generally in good shape and reasonably spacious. Perhaps the only weakness was a lack of a vacuum, which meant that the carpet in living room became surprisingly stuffed with particles. 
  The host  was efficient and took pains to do a good operation. Often helpful, such as providing (an empty) metro card.
  Unfortunately, it has proved impossible to reach him afterwards. It's frustrating, because I seem to have left something valuable. Repeated mails have gone unanswered. 
  All in all, good value for the money, but with some caveats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lounge area and kitchen are very nice spaces to hang out with a lot of natural light. The location is great, with the train station, a supermarket, bars/restaurants, and an amazing Asian food court just minutes walk away. Giuseppe and his house mate were really friendly and helpful.

There are two drawers in the room, as well as a water sink so you can wash hands in your room. There is no desk and chair in the room,but that is shown in the photo of the room already.

37141039,2015-07-05,29726587,Shannon,Although not physically present at the apartment Guiseppe was always available on phone and email.  He was always quick to answer all my requests and to deal with any issues pertaining to the running of the apartment. The description of the room was quite accurate and yes the room was quite small which is fine if you are only planning on using the room for sleeping. I found the inclusion of a sink in the room to be quite helpful particularly when sharing a single bathroom with 4 others. The apartment had good access to grocery stores and public transport which meant that it was an easy neighbourhood to live in. The Apartment was a half hour T trip to the heart of Boston and a half hour bus trip to Cambridge during peak hours but a good budget option for visiting either of these locations. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bedroom was small, comfortable and definitely suitable for one person. The place is located within close walking distance of two supermarkets and various other shops, and a T and bus station are also very conveniently located and reachable within about 5 minutes.

52581468,2015-10-31,7936293,Joachim,I stayed at Giuseppes shared flat for two months. The room is exactly as described and i felt very welcome. It was like living in my shared flat at home. Everyone has their tasks and can use the whole flat. Giuseppe was very friendly and answered every question i had in no time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53873137,2015-11-14,35654413,Viviana,"My stay in Allston was great! The room was cozy, even if very small, and the house in general was comfortable. The flat is very close to the T station (green line B), so it's perfect for reaching Downtown and every other connection. Giuseppe was a good host, always careful and available. He wasn't always there, but Joana, one of the other roommates, was a perfect substitute. She really cared about my needs, and my content.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

71077701,2016-04-23,59699814,Alejandro,"Giuseppe es una persona muy atenta, que responde de forma rápida y cordial cualquier cuestión que puedas tener. Como dice en el anuncio, la habitación es bastante pequeña, tiene un lavabo, una cama y un armario. La cama es cómoda en cualquier caso. La casa es antigua, aunque está bien conservada y puede parecer hasta misteriosa (por ejemplo, tiene una escalera trasera para bajar al sótano). La casa está relativamente limpia, aunque al ser varios compañeros, todos tenemos que hacer nuestra parte para que siga así. La zona es agradable: la casa está cerca de Commonwealth Ave., una calle llena de tiendas, restaurantes, etc. y por la que pasa la línea verde de metro. También es una zona con mucha vida, ya que está al lado de Boston University y hay muchos estudiantes universitarios. El barrio suele ser tranquilo, aunque a veces los estudiantes que viven cerca (o en el mismo bloque) montan fiestas, por lo que en ocasiones puede haber bastante ambiente por la noche. La cocina es amplia y está equipada con todo lo necesario para cocinar, y aunque no dispone de salón tiene un pequeño hall con un sofá bastante cómodo. Tanto la cocina como el hall son lugares adecuados para trabajar, al no tener la habitación un escritorio.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

96812289,2016-08-24,3803857,Mohan,"After having been a guest so many times in my life, I feel very strongly that it's the people who make the stay, more so than anything about the place itself. As advertised, my room was small and minimal---and Allston itself isn't the most upscale part of Boston. But none of that mattered much after being taken in and instantly treated as a regular old housemate. I quickly felt at home even though I was as far removed from my actual home as I could be. You'll do well here if you're a solo traveler who prefers to blend in with the locals, students, and young professionals without much fuss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were very cozy despite it being a blustery winter weekend.  Downtown Boston was visible from our room on the 3rd floor and, though the T was nearby, we enjoyed walking into town.  What a good value-- we'd stay there again in a heartbeat.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We stayed in a smaller room the first night and then moved to a larger room after. It was nice to have the extra space and full kitchen. Although we did not see our host, we had plenty of communication via message as well as many things left for us in the room. Would definitely recommend.

He got maps, attraction spots and restaurant tips all planned out ready to pick up in the room, and he takes his time to explain to us where we were, and how to get to one point to another. The room we stayed was very charming and clean.  It has everything you need, and we loved the bathroom.  It is only minutes away from the subway station and bus stops, and takes only 10 to 15 minutes to go everywhere. Thanks a lot, Terry!  We had a good time.

-the location was in a nice neighborhood just at the edge of the city, with a 15-20 min subway ride to center city Boston (the subway station is only a 5 min walk from Terry's place)
-Immaculately clean and comfortable room, with fresh sheets, towels, and everything else you might need for your stay (tons of tourist guidebooks, toiletries, fridge, coffee maker, snacks, etc)
-We did not get to see Terry, but he was accessible by phone even at late hours and was very helpful in making sure we got into our room okay

I highly recommend Terry's place, and if you visit Boston definitely do the Freedom Trail Walk that starts at Boston Common!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The location is great, less than 5 minute walk to the Roxbury Crossing underground, although you can walk into town in about 20mins. I have no hesitation in recommending Hotel Alternative and would happily stay again if I'm back in Boston.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terry, our host, was very welcoming as well as helpful, leaving us maps and suggestions of things to do.   The room was beautiful, cozy and clean.

We will not only  be staying here for future trips to Boston but will also be recommending it to any family or friends planning to visit the area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The house has a heap of character and my room was a lot better than I had first expected.  The bedroom was big, the shower had a tonne of pressure, and the bed was super comfy. I got an awesome nights sleep before having to fly half way around the world.

Overall Terry is a top bloke and I would definately recommend his accommodation to anyone looking to stay in Boston.

The place is really easy to get to on public transportation and Terry's directions were perfect. It's a quiet neighbourhood so if you're looking to be right in the middle of things, you might want to stay closer to the city centre. But if you're looking for a quiet place to stay with easy access to everything via the T, this is a great spot.

He sets the bar high on all fronts: beautifully decorated, clean, spacious, comfortable, affordable & full of amenities.  Easy communication & check-in/out. Great location, lovely neighborhood & FREE street parking (practically in front of the place). The 1st 2 nights I stayed at the 2 bedroom duplex apartment. My first night was at the tail end of a heat wave (it was 88 degrees out) but Terry's place was perfectly cool & comfortable. The a/c was on when I got there, with a few lights & low background music making it very welcoming. The 3rd night I was in the Private Room & Bath  which was also very lovely. It was well-equipped, and great to have the microwave and mini-fridge (there's plates/silverware and just about anything you could need in the cabinet). I slept well on the very comfy beds at both places. Glad I got to meet Terry as I was leaving:)... (though he had been available & we communicated through text during my stay).

I appreciated the air conditioning on two of my three nights there, as the humidity was pretty high for the first few days of my visit. The well equipped kitchenette in the corner of the room came in handy too. I really enjoy staying in residential neighborhoods, rather than at big downtown chain hotels. This was ideal for me. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a notebook with information about local restaurants and things to see. I didn't make use of that as I was here for a workshop, but it was a nice touch. A very charming place to stay. I'd stay there again next time I have to be in the Longwood Medical area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location is great once you know how to use the quick train service into Boston.

Terry's spot has a classic Boston feel with hardwood floors, exposed brick, etc.  The apartment is cozy and has a well equipped kitchen, good heating, DVD player and all the amenities you need.  It's a short walk to the Roxbury Crossing subway station and the overall value is great considering you'd pay double for a decent hotel room in the city.

Terry was a great host and offers tips and tricks for touring the city, grabbing food, etc.  Would highly recommend staying here!

Although not of concern to us, the steep stairs to the bedroom would be an issue for anyone with mobility issues.  The neighbourhood does not have many coffee houses, restaurants.shops or tourist attractions although the train station is quick and easy to access and only three stops from the Back Bay area where these facilities are abundant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1528191,2012-06-21,2101074,Steve,"The apartment was clean, comfortable, and well-furnished.  It was always nice to come ""home"" to during our five-night stay.  Terry was polite and always available by phone to answer questions.  The neighborhood was quiet, and we felt safe.  As others have noted, the metal spiral stairs to the bedroom downstairs are a bit tight, but it wasn't much of an issue for us.  Highly recommended!

1600195,2012-07-01,1548872,Burkhard,"Terry's home was very clean and the furnishing was very thought thru and well equipped. There was plenty of material such as maps and broshures.
The apartment is right near the T station Roxbury crossing and from there it is just a matter of minutes to get right into the center of Boston. 
The communication with Terry worked very well. He answered our emails right away. 
We certainly do recommend the apartment to other guests. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2570960,2012-10-10,3165379,Melody,Apartment was well appointed and nicely furnished.  It's within walking distance of transit and not more than a 15 minute drive to local attractions. Would highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting the Boston area. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2632123,2012-10-16,3322916,Neil,Terry was a great host and very accessible.  The apartment was fabulous and had all the amenities I could ask for.

Overall I was really pleased with my stay and would highly recommend staying there. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4393715,2013-05-02,1781034,Marvin,"This was my first trip to Boston, so I took a bit of a shot with this listing because I didn't know the neighborhoods or lay of the land at all. But the location turned out to be perfect - I lucked out. You will be roughly the equivalent of three city blocks from the T (Orange line Roxbury Crossing) if you cut through Roxbury Community College campus. From there, you're two stops from Mass Ave and Tremont and a short walk to trendy South End, or hop on the #1 bus and be on Newbury in 10 minutes. Go one more stop to Back Bay and your in Copley Square or Boston Commons The apt itself, is beautiful. It's quiet, handy, full of amenities, and Terry could not have been more courteous and helpful. I rented a car for a couple day-trips and parking on Centre Street was a breeze, and it was a quick shot east to I-93 with easy access to the cape, beaches, airport, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maine. I had a perfect vacation, due largely to the fact that I had a great and convenient place to stay. Thanks Terry!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4446364,2013-05-06,2723495,Elizabeth & Dan,"The Fort Hill Inn was remarkably convenient and comfortable! With the quiet surroundings and plush bed I got the best sleep ever on a Boston trip. Don't need earplugs to sleep here! Our guest who used the sofa bed had no complaints either. 
We were so busy we did not have a chance to use the well equipped kitchen.The coffee from Butterfly Coffee/Cafe at Roxbury Crossing was so good! No decaf at Butterfly but coffee very smooth nonetheless. 
The ""Hubway"" positioned right at the T station made it super convenient to rent a bike and see the city. Just remember to check that bike in every 30 minutes to a Hubway bike stand. We biked along the Charles and over to Old Ironsides in Charlestown to be tourists and then back. Biked over to Newbury Street for dinner at Stephanie's later that evening. Absolutely exhilarating and such fun!
Had a mechanical problem with a door lock that Terry took care of immediately much to our relief. Terry is very responsive and we felt we were in good hands.

6734665,2013-08-23,294553,Renee,"I was a bit nervous about staying here due to reviews about safety. Rest assured, this area is super safe. Do not take a cab here. Cab drivers only know downtown. Take the T, its cheaper and easier. Terry greeted us and broke down the area for us. We love the layout of the apartment.  Our only hiccup was the shower as the temperature was all over the place but that's wasn't a big deal to us as we live in NYC and in our apts the same thing can happen.  Plan to eat at The Squealing Pig in Mission Hill it has a great vibe and food. For most of the trip, plan to eat the Back Bay Area as there are some great places around the house but not as many options as we New Yorkers are use to. We had the run of the second apartment and very much enjoyed our stay. If you have any questions, Terry is a text away. We would return to The Fort Hill Inn in any future visits to the area.

29th,2013. Terry the host was great. He was there when I
Arrived to check me in. The check in was easy. Terry helped me bring my luggage to the apartment. The place 
Was squeaky clean! The kitchen and bathroom was immaculate ! I really enjoyed staying here! The T is just a 5 minute walk away from the Inn. I parked my car on the street for 3 days. The neighborhood Is very safe and welcoming . I would definitely stay here again the next 
Time I visit Boston! Good job Terry and thank you for making my visit a pleasant experience!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8447974,2013-10-31,2895852,Joanie,"Bar none, the best accommodations I have experienced on AirBnb!
Beautifully furnished, thoughtfully appointed, it covered everything.  Terri has a great eye, which makes for a more comfortable stay.  He has thought of EVERYTHING, from offering not-run-of-the-mill guides (even a large, laminated map of Boston tastefully set on the coffee table; great for easier planning), to a fully stocked bathroom that was better planned than I was for this trip!  He was kind and courteous, greeting me to make sure I had everything I needed after checking in.  This is how attentive he is; when I answered the door with my coat still on, he checked in to make sure the apartment was too cold (it wasn't.). 

A good host pays attention to the details!

Incredibly convenient, Terri's place is a leisurely 3-5 minute walk to public transportation.  Area layout:  T station, Community College directly across the street, then Terri's place behind that.  That easy! 

Being that there is a police station within visible distance of the block, always an extra assurance to a traveler.  A few minutes in any direction will take you to some great museums (Isabella Stewart Gardner!), pubs, architecturally gorgeous churches.  What a nice suburban insight, off the beaten path.  Terri's neighborhood is beautiful and friendly.

You can't go wrong with Terri's place.  It's your home away from home, maybe even a little bit better.  Incredible deal and value for such luxury.  Why pay the same price for some generic chain that is the same in Oklahoma, Washington, or Ohio?  Go for something more memorable and personal.  :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9103225,2013-12-07,4586728,Hilary,"Convenient to the T and in a quiet little cul-de-sac. There was always a place to park, too.  Comfortable furnishings and the kitchen had what we needed to cook some food for ourselves (pots, pans, etc.).  We were there for work and didn't have much free time in the neighborhood but we did take a walk up to the park at the top of the hill and it was very scenic - William Lloyd Garrison's house was on the way back!  Will definitely be back for our next trip!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13339566,2014-05-26,476856,Francis,"Terry was an excellent host responding promptly to all enquiries before and after our booking.  We actually only met him very briefly during our stay as we were out a lot. 

The fact that we only met him this once is a testament to the effective arrangements he has in place for checking in and checking out. Also, we found everything in the apartment was in working order therefore there was no need to trouble him.

The apartment was as described in the listing and in excellent shape with clear instructions on various matters. Strong Wi-Fi signal was available.

The neighborhood was fine. It was fairly quiet and we always felt safe. The Roxbury Crossing ‘T’ station is a short 4 to 5 minute walk away and with trains every 10 minutes or so you are downtown in no time at all (10 minute ride to Downtown Crossing). 

If you are staying for more than a couple of days an $18 MBTA weekly pass is excellent value as it includes trains, buses and the inner harbor water taxi. It is also very easy to travel to/from the airport using the ‘T’ (approx. 40 min) saving on expensive taxis/ shuttles.

Cannot comment on local shopping, as we tended to bring in groceries from the excellent Wholefoods Market in downtown Boston.

We had a great time in Boston and if we return to the city we would be delighted to stay at Terry’s place again.

13953399,2014-06-09,13606185,Natalie,Terry was quick to respond to all messages.  We did not have any interaction with Terry while we were in town but I have no doubt that he would have responded quickly if we needed anything.  As a testament to his wonderful planning his apartment was easily found based on his directions.  A quick walk from the T.  We did not rent a car while in Boston as the public transportation was so easy to manage and so close to the condo.  There were tons of information regarding tourist spots in the condo in case you want to look for additional places to go.  Wifi was great along with the cable tv.  We did not make use of the kitchen but it was nicely equipped.  Terry's condo was approximately half the price of a hotel during the time period we stayed and we had MORE room than a hotel.  Very comfortable furnishings.  This being our first airbnb experience has made us look further into using this service for future trips.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apartment was in excellent condition, very comfortable, spacious and very clean. The apartment that shows the photos is not the same as that which we arrived. The bedroom and the bathroom are in the basement, where the noise of the air conditioning was noted. 
In the apartment there are maps of the city and tourist information.
WIFI works very good.
The neighborhood: it is very quiet. We had a car, and found enough space to park free. We used it every day, especially to avoid the night walk from the subway station to the house, the trip is not long but it is lonely.
Terry: received us on arrival, very friendly and helpful. We only bothered him to help us open the suitcase because we had lost the key to the lock and he solved the issue very efficiently. The rest of the time we communicate by email",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 se mostró conciliador y permitiéndonos dejar nuestras maletas, al final la limpieza estaba acabada y pudimos instalarnos. Apreciamos la flexibilidad y la buena disposición. Terry nos acogió con mucha amabilidad y nos proporciono información interesante sobre Boston. La casa se correspondía al anuncio, muy limpia, acogedora y con sensación de hogar. Nos sentimos muy a gusto. Las comunicaciones con la T son cercanas y rápidas.
Sin embargo creo necesario añadir que la zona puede parecer algo insegura, advertencia que nos hizo el taxista que nos llevo allí. No tuvimos ninguna mala experiencia pero sí uno es sensible con este tema esto no es una buena opción.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

71347850,2016-04-24,18601159,Jennifer,"The Fort Hill Inn was a very nicely renovated brick row house on a tiny dead end side street.  The immediate neighborhood felt very safe, had close access to the T, and best of all had easy access to free parking, as we had traveled to Boston in 2 cars.  The delightful host Terry was in and out of the property (I believe he lives upstairs) and was available to assist us in anything we needed--including recommending an auto service shop as we encountered some car trouble on our travels.  Plenty of maps and Boston guides as well as some Uber coupons left for us on the mantel.  We felt so comfortable and at home in the beautifully decorated apartment--an eclectic mix of old, thrift, fancy and useful-- Terry has a great eye for what you would expect to find in this kind of building! Plus the kitchen was well stocked with essential items for cooking.  Although we had a car with us, we preferred using the T and Uber during our stay so we didn't have to deal with driving headaches in downtown Boston.  The location of this apartment made that easy and economical.  We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay at this place and will definitely stay here again when we come back to Boston!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you plan on using this location and have a vehicle, be aware that Tueday mornings is tricky. Streets are cleaned between 8-12 so make plans to leave before 8.  I couldn't easily find a place to park and I ended up getting a parking ticket. 

The unit itself was awesome. Very home like and clean. Would definitely recommend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondly Phil's rental is located in a great area surrounded by parks making it nice and quite and yet it close enough to city center which is easily accessible by walking, biking or taking a bus.
Rental room is very nice and has all that's needed to make it comfortable!

The room is well furnished and clean, with a comfortable bed, plenty of closet and drawer space, and a nice desk.  TV and sound system too. Phil was extremely hospitable about use of the kitchen and laundry, as well as helping out with rides.  The backyard is awesome - and in summer weather I imagine it would be a great place to relax.  The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and residential - but close to the commuter rail which takes you to downtown Boston in 15 minutes.  There are some really interesting shops in Roslindale Village - just a 7 minute walk from the house.   Supposedly it has the best farmer's market in Boston. 
...and...
if you enjoy Mexican folk art, Phil's home will be especially fun for you.
I highly recommend staying there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
341306,2011-06-28,579421,Daniela,Phil is a very friendly host and I felt safe and comfortable in Roslindale. It's a very quiet and nice neighbourhood. You have easy access to the commuter train station at Roslindale Village (if you don't mind walking appr. 15 minutes) - but especially on weekends there is only limited service (on Sundays even no service at all). But you can also take the T orange line to Forest Hill and take a bus (there are several lines). If you like to explore Boston during daytime and have quiet evenings and like walking it's worth a stay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond the parameters of the room, Phil's home is very clean and comfortable to move around in - and filled with beautiful artisan pieces from Mexico! His stories are as colorful as the art pieces he displays. Beyond his knack for conversation, Phil is a supremely kind host, offering rides and opening his home in ways that made me feel like I was staying with a close relative, not with someone I had just met. Outside of the home, there are restaurants, small shops, and a gorgeous park nearby. Public transportation to downtown and around Boston is easy, as the commuter rail is a 15 minute walk and the orange T-line is a short bus ride away (which can be boarded a block from his home). I can easily recommend staying with Phil with no reservations. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phil is a great host. He kindly provided me with a bath towel, coffee and breads, a new teeth brush and any useful information on Boston, and also he took me to the station with his car.
The location is calm but the public transportation is limited. If you will come back at late time in weekend, you will have to take a taxi from Forest Hills station (It costs $8 or so) or walk 30 minutes.

He is a great cook too, I was once invited to try lobster and his banana bread is awesome !

The house is clean and quiet and so is the neighborhood. Phil is pretty much all the time attending his online business at the studio, so you won't notice him very much.  The bathroom is shared but is very clean and you will get your own cabinet.

The place was clean and comfortable, especially Phil was friendly and helpful. We were welcome to share the kitchen. Some places were not.  Well, for me, to say hello and good bye is pretty important in my culture, therefore, we expected host at least saying such things. Phil was way much over the expectation.

The place was big enough, confortable and located near public transportaion. I would recommend this place to everyone !! I really enjoyed staying with him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7702734,2013-09-30,7785147,Chey,"I could not be happier with my first Airbnb experience. Having Phil as a host, to be fair, most likely had something to do with it. The room and environment was exactly as advertised with my space being clean, private and functional. I had full access to Phil's kitchen, bathroom and laundry amenities as needed. Phil himself was pleasantly conversant yet professionally distant to help maintain his and my work schedules. I was able to leave early in the morning and come back late per the duties of a medical student without incident.  I highly recommend Phil's Airbnb listing to anyone wishing to study or needing temporary housing in the Boston area. If I ever needed to return to Boston in similar circumstances, I would surely see if Phil was available. He is a great asset to the Airbnb community. Thanks for a wonderful experience!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7952430,2013-10-09,9034365,Mahavir,"Staying at Phil's was an excellent way to start off my airbnb journey. Given that I am a noob at airbnb there was a mild hesitation but I am glad I took a leap of faith and stayed at Phil's. Phil is an excellent host and a person. He was very helpful, accommodating and fun to talk with. I had a key to myself and he was fine with me walking in anytime. He gave me access to his washer/dryer in the basement which was very useful. He also suggested a bunch of good places to see around Boston. 

About the house:
Safe friendly neighborhood.
Old quaint house with lots of character. 
Tons of interesting art pieces (like Phil mentioned in his ad)
The room is spacious for one/two people with ample of storage.
The bathroom is clean and in good condition.
Plenty streetside parking available outside.
The house is very close to Arnold Arboretum so it is a great place to be in if you like to explore!

Overall I would definitely recommend staying at Phil's if you are around the area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8095574,2013-10-15,1644716,Angel,"Phil is an excellent host, he went above and beyond by taking me to the train station my 1st morning there to make sure I could find it (it is however only a short walk from the house....very convenient for getting into downtown).  He was also a wealth of information about things I might like to do but would not have discovered on my own. The room is clean and comfortable.  I felt very safe both in his home and in the neighborhood.  Thanks Phil!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

12094709,2014-04-22,10932793,Bill,"Phil was quick to respond and to reach out before the trip to make sure my stay was a pleasant one. The location was great - quick to the bus stop (but not walkable to the T). Bus service is frequent, so it was fine for me.

Phil was super flexible about when I checked in and went out of his way to make me feel welcome. It's clear why he has repeat customers. Breakfast makings available and free reign in the kitchen. Good coffee (french press style) was available (although I ended up running out every morning before taking advantage of it.) 

Their is a 7-11 less than a block away as well as a restaurant or two that I noticed. Parking was easy. Super quite and safe neighborhood (I caught the wrong bus one night and had to walk about a mile around midnight). 

Thanks Phil for a great first AirBnB experience!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12966551,2014-05-15,4699326,Robert,"Very quiet neighborhood and Phil opens up his apartment home to make your stay pleasant and stress free. If you stay here there is free street parking and the apartment is less than half a block from the bus stop. The room and the shared bathroom are clean. 

I've stayed here before and returning for a short stay felt very much like visiting family.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phil had coffee and bagels waiting for me in the morning and he even gave me a snack for the road. The neighborhood felt very safe and has a bar/restaurant, taco joint and convenience store within walking distance. Parking was no problem. I would recommend this listing and this host. Thanks Phil!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17602469,2014-08-14,12803661,Ramon,Phil was an extremely pleasant and kind host.  He was a very giving person and made the stay that much better.

18573887,2014-08-28,19195786,Troy,I couldn't have asked for a better host for my first few days in Boston. Phil gave me expert advice on how to get around town and even drove me a few places on weekends when the public transportation came less frequently. The neighborhood is full of character and things to do. I leave my highest endorsement. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18641466,2014-08-29,14079909,Michael,"Phil was the absolute best!!  After responding within minutes of my last-second request, he waited up late for my arrival (12:30a) and greeted me with a bowl of delicious, homemade minestrone soup.   He was so kind and gracious throughout my stay.  He even drove me to the T station, so I didn't have to walk.  He was the absolute best and I would stay with him again in a second.  I would give six stars if I could.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22181464,2014-11-01,10605904,Jose,"Phil is an amazing host. Always tried to make my stay more comfortable, and was very helpful. He has a very relaxed attitude, which I found to be very pleasant. The room was quite large, and had everything I could possibly need. The room had two windows with a view of his garden, and the decor was also nice. Phil let me use his kitchen, and it had everything I needed.
The house is in a very nice and safe neighborhood. Bus stops are very near (2 min walking). 
I would definitely come back!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30330541,2015-04-20,7916597,Steve,"My wife & I stayed with Phil for 2 nights when we came over from the UK for the Boston Marathon.  Phil was a delightful host, with the facilities and ambiance of his place being informal and relaxed; exactly what we required. There was good contact with Phil from before our arrival; he was a really convivial host & more than happy for us to use his kitchen (& eat his banana bread!).  It’s a 10min bus ride from the end of Phil’s street to the Orange Line terminus, so you can be downtown in 30mins.  On Sunday, when the bus didn’t run, Phil generously offered & gave us a ride to the ‘T’.  Phil’s place is clean, private, quiet and just a wee bit quirky, with his pieces of Mexican folk art in which he trades peering at you from all directions!  Some are a little bizarre - but in a nice way!  There’s a sports bar, a Mexican restaurant and a Pizza/pasta takeout just round the corner and a 7-11 at the end of the street.  Overall, we enjoyed our brief stay tremendously; just a shame there wasn’t more time to continue the good conversations.  Thank you Phil – you and your place were just the kind of casual, hassle-free bolthole we needed for our short stay in Boston.

32145906,2015-05-14,4699326,Robert,"I was at Phil's place for 2 weeks for a short work assignment. Staying here was convenient with ample street parking, full use of the kitchen, and a quiet room.

I very much enjoyed chatting with Phil about his travels and day to day life and his expertise about Boston (as a native) was invaluable to my housing search. This was my first Airbnb experience and Phil has set the bar very high. He was also kind and flexible when my plans changed. I would definitely recommend staying with Phil for those headed to Boston, particularly by car, as his street offers ample parking and quick access to local arteries.

48403750,2015-09-26,35818731,Martin,"I stayed with Phil for three months over the summer of 2015. Phil provided me with a comfortable room in his pleasant, art-filled apartment. It was a very convenient location for Faulkner Hospital where I was working....a 20 minute walk. Also, the apartment is a handy place for Forest Hills T-station...a nice walk through the Arboretum. Phil is a great host and, in fact, an all-around good bloke.
110% recommendation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50785292,2015-10-14,25174316,Lydia,"I was in Boston for a convention and Phil made my stay there super comfortable and friendly. He was very accommodating and helpful - he was quite generous with his time in assisting me with my stay even though he runs his business from home. The room is cozy and clean, with plenty of desk area for when I needed to do some work. Also when he had the time, Phil even gave me a ride to where I needed to go (I didn't have a car and mostly took the bus/train) and he was very kind to offer me a few home-cooked meals though I mostly ate out at nearby restaurants. His house is beautifully decorated with lots of folk art and I enjoyed hearing his travel and life stories. He has great information and tips on the local sights and dining options as well as commute options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bedroom was perfect for me: pleasantly arranged with a very comfortable bed, with a large desk that I wish I had an opportunity to use. The room was conveniently next to both the bathroom and kitchen. I felt very comfortable and at home at Phil's place.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a convenience store and a few restaurants around the corner and Roslindale Village is about a fifteen minute walk away. Getting to/from downtown Boston can take a bit of time especially during the evening or Sunday's when buses run less frequently so make sure to leave plenty of time if you have appointments there.

Well done.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14477,2009-10-21,41425,Tim,"We had a good time staying in Boston. Anne Sasser is a realestate manager who handles multiple places including longer stays. She therefore knows her business and is very flexible. The apartment was in a nice building on Beacon street, right next to the Mass State house; so very conveniently located, and clean enough, although the cutlery could have been a little cleaner. The appliances were all fine and laundry was easy enough. I would recommend this stay if you are out all day like we were. The rate is very reasonable and better than any hotel in that area, and there is a kitchen so you don't have to go out every night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She worked with us on some scheduling issues for check in and out and we felt we were in good hands. The apartment was just right, so comfortable and in a perfect location for walking to all of Boston's main sights, or to hop on the T. While there is street noise the window fan helped mask that. It also was a very interesting old building and we felt very safe. would love to return tomorrow!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10660675,2014-03-02,11232045,Andrea,"The apartment is perfect for anyone who needs a furnished place to stay for either several days or several weeks.  I rented this place for one month so I got a good feel for the building and the unit.  The unit is very much as described, actually a bit nicer than the pictures do it justice.   The kitchen has much of what you need for simple cooking and a decent counter space to work with.  The bathroom is recently renovated. There is a bit of street noise but that was pretty much concentrated on Fri or Sat evenings, not during the week.  The heat can either be on or off, but that worked just fine to regulate the temperature. 

The building is quite nice with a lovely lobby and nicely maintained common areas.  You feel very safe and it is generally very quiet, you are unlikely to even see many other residents. 

The location is AMAZING for anyone wishing to be downtown to explore, tour, enjoy the great city of Boston.  A few minutes walk from Park St T stop, Beacon Hill, Back Bay, Financial District. You can see the Boston Common.  

Anne was a fine host - responsive to inquiries during rental process, had the unit cleaned and organized for my arrival, and was responsive to my questions during my stay.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The restaurant next door is great, and there is a convenience store on the corner.  The view from the top deck is fantastic.

Make sure to re-read the fine print on the complex's $100 move-in requirement - we would have forgotten to bring a check if Anne hadn't reminded us right before. The unit was out of TP, but Anne brought some for us the next day.  She was very accommodating on a late check-out - we left our luggage there before our night flight so we could still explore. I would love to see a guest book of maps and restaurant recommendations - there were a couple guidebooks, but they were a bit out of date. The location is perfect - perfect- perfect for sightseeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Looking at all the options available, Frank's place was the perfect location at a great price. It's a 3-story walk-up with the second and third-stories being the apartment. We were on a road trip up there from Atlanta, and were caught in a huge thunderstorm on the way. I almost thought that our reservation had been cancelled, but Frank pulled through at the last minute and allowed us to stay. If you saw the pictures of the place, they don't really do justice. The place was immaculately clean. They left us fresh towels and soap. The private parking area with gated lock was also great for leaving the car without worry. My only regret is not being able to stay longer.

The view from the backyard balconies isn't captured by pictures, really a nice plus to our stay.  There were even binoculars on the shelf inside the house to use.  The kitchen was stocked with many essentials (tea, seasonings and sugars, all the cooking pans/pots) so for those who want to cook, this is a great place.  

Getting out of East Boston towards downtown will cost you $3.50 each time you exit, unless you go the long way around and avoid the toll, but for the money you save on rent on this place it's totally worth it.  There aren't extensive grocery shops or cafes nearby, but there are a few cute restaurants.

The place was clean, nicely decorated, and very cute.  Comfortably slept two adult couples in the respective upstairs/downstairs beds, and a few kids in the upstairs living room.  :)  There was a nice park nearby that we drove by, but didn't see until our last day, but seemed like a nice place to spend an afternoon by the water.  

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you have a car and can easily commute.  If you don't have a car, the T is a 10-15 walk away, so not bad either.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46507065,2015-09-11,41275346,Alexa,"Frank's place was very clean and spacious. Plenty of room for 4 people and additional privacy with bedrooms on separate floors. The home matches and is even better than what is in the pictures. You can view the harbor from the balconies and the short proximity to the harborwalk was great. It is right in a residential area near a park, so it was great to interact with the locals.

Frank's response time for emails was quite reasonable, and he was easy to work with to set up my visit (as this was my first time using Airbnb). I felt a little overwhelmed by all the instructions Frank provided, but they were very detailed and had helpful suggestions for the area. I would highly recommend staying here!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
83021395,2016-06-30,66856188,Øystein,"Franks place was the perfect place to stay in Boston for our family of two adults and two kids. The apartment is cosy, was very clean and had everything we needed for our seven week stay.
We didn't have a car, but that was no problem with the bus passing just a few steps down the road taking us to the T(subway) in a few minutes, and only a few T-stops from downton Boston and transfer to all other T-lines. The bus also tok us right to and from the supermarket, which was also very convenient.
The apartment is close to the airport, so we was a bit worried about noise - but it was very quiet and no problem at all. Being so close to the airport was actually very convenient since it is only a 5 minute walk to the airports carrental-center and also the airport shuttlebus.
The neiborhood is also quiet and there are both nice parks, playgrounds and basketcourses in the area(perfect for relaxing or playing with the kids).
The host Frank was very friendly, and is easy to communicate with on email - always answering the same day or the next morning if we had any questions.
So if you're planning a trip to Boston I would absolutely recommend this place!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you have heavy luggage, please be aware that there is no elevator.

1733580,2012-07-17,2640345,Tino Nicolas,"PROS: 

Location was great and the apt looked exactly how it was pictured. The bed was comfortable, we had two sets of clean sheets and several towels. Soap and shampoo were also provided.

CONS: 

Air conditioner was not controlled from our room (8), but from room number 7. Therefore we had NO control at all about the temperature of our location and during the whole time we were freezing. We called Seamless transitions several times and the most they could do was offering to call to room number 7 or some extra blankets. Neither of those resolved our problem. 

Overall: 

Great experience and would book it again, no doubt! 
It would have been a 5/5 should the A/C had been controlled from our room.

4506191,2013-05-09,5718485,M.,"The neighborhood is great - really close to shopping, Hynes, and Backbay. The room itself was very clean and well-kept and looked exactly like the pictures. It was quiet and overall the stay was very pleasant.

My only complaint was that the promised free wifi did not work. The signal would appear for a minute or so and then disappear. I tried on multiple devices (Mac and PC) and never had any luck. I emailed Kitty at Seamless Transition and never heard back from her during my stay (or since). 

All in all - this was my first AirBnB experience and it overall was a very good one. However, if you are planning on getting any work done and need a wifi signal do not count on there being one. You'll  have to head to the nearest Starbucks. I was also a bit disappointed that I never heard back from them.

I needed a place to stay at the last minute when all of Boston was booked and Kitty was awesome and worked to help find me a place.

Only downside was the steep, narrow stairs to get up to the 3rd floor.  

The mattress was hard but acceptable. I would definitely rent this place again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The units are beautifully renovated and furnished, and it really was seamless to get into our place. The location was absolutely amazing - we were in the center of everything we visited in Boston. This is definitely the place to stay if you like to make yourself at home for a few days. The unit was also spotlessly clean. The only downsides were that it was short on the extra touch amenities that really make a place stand out - it was missing things like salt + pepper in the kitchen, shampoo in the bathroom, and kitchen towels. The main office staff was super helpful on our check out day and let us leave our bags for a number of hours. I imagine that you could request amenities if you needed them.

Its also close to public transportation, so easy to get to other areas in the city. The apartment is a 3rd floor (or higher) walkup, but wasn't a problem for me as a fit younger person. My girlfriend, however, faced some difficulties with the climb. 

The space is not big, but at the discounted price its a good value. One drawback was the matress, it was firm bordering on too hard. Still fine though.

18911397,2014-09-02,8205684,Adrienne,"My husband and I were very disappointed with our stay. The photos aren't the same photos as the room itself. These photos show a bay window and a much larger kitchen, and our room had a (non-bay) window that was covered with fire escapes and overlooked another brick building and the kitchen was significantly smaller. On top of that, a lamp didn't work, the water in the tub wouldn't drain, and it was overall in very shabby condition. We were shocked at the price we paid for a motel quality room. Needless to say, we won't be staying here again. At the price they're charging, you're better off at a hotel.

The one good thing I will say is that the location is excellent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The service of the reception of the building was not good/helpful at the time I arrived. I arrived at 12pm but the reception told me the check-in time is 3pm (I have no idea about this at all!). Besides, he was looking kinda ""not my business"".

However, there are different shift during a day, and very soon I found that most of the reception assistant there were quite nice and helpful.

For the place itself, this is te best one among all the apartments I stayed in Bangkok and China.
