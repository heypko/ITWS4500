I have easy, restriction-free, on-street parking here, and a back yard. Just one block from the house, there is a 7-11 convenience store, a dry-cleaner, a Mexican restaurant, a pizza parlor, a popular sports bar and grill (similar to an Irish Pub), and another restaurant for breakfast and lunch.  The house is located 1/2 mile from Roslindale Square where you will find more restaurants, 4 bakeries, the public library and the post office. There is a superb farmers market here every Saturday. The fast-train to downtown Boston stops there, too.","I am in a scenic part of Boston with a couple big parks nearby, and Jamaica Pond, where you can rent a sail boat or jog the paved perimeter path, within a mile away. Here is a clue to my personality:  Favorite singers are Judy Collins, Ari Hest, Miguel Bose and the British rock band, James. My top favorite places to travel to are Oaxaca, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary. In years gone by, I have had repeated trips to Paris and to Tunisia, also. These days I am mostly home, spending a lot of time in front of my iMac, writing copy, filling orders or coding for websites.","PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: From the house, quick public transportation to Forest Hills station (Orange Line and Commuter Rail) is via two nearby MBTA bus lines. The #38 bus stops one-half block away, and takes you past the Faulkner, then to Jamaica Plain and Forest Hills.  The #51 bus stops one block away, and goes a more direct route to Forest Hills. (The bus also goes to Cleveland Circle in Brookline.) Between the two bus lines, there is a bus that stops here every 15 minutes or so on weekdays; but no service on Sunday. ALSO, the apartment is just 1/2 mile walk to the Roslindale Village MBTA commuter rail stop, Needham Line. The train takes you to Ruggles Station at Northeastern Univ., to Back Bay station and to South Station in downtown Boston, in about 15 minutes time.  There are more city busses, running 7 days a week, from this MBTA rail station. You can also pick up ZIP Cars there.  GETTING HERE FROM LOGAN AIRPORT: By public transportation: You take the free shuttle bus at the airpo","I am living in the apartment during your stay, and I work from home, so I'm there most of the time.

In recent years I have had many trips to Mexico, where I buy folk art for my online business, called Viva Oaxaca Folk Art. I love meeting new people, especially travelers with stories to tell.  

In addition to the above, I run web sites for small companies, including a physical therapy practice, a cancer treatment center and a colonial era historic house and museum. 

In the 1980s, I was a publicist and concert producer, and have presented many concerts with Judy Collins, as well as with Ella Fitzgerald, Laura Nyro, Tom Rush, Barbara Cook and Karen Akers. Now I run a channel on YouTube called ""beta.hifi.archive"" that is a collection of 50 years of video clips from the career of Judy Collins.
